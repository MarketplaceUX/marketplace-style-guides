##Buttons & Controls
There are 4 types of buttons sizes: `tiny` (24px high), `small` (36px high), `medium` (48px high), and `large` (60px high). Each size has a specific use: `tiny` is used for the purchase button on mobile devices. 'small' is used for I DUNNO. NEEDED? `medium` is used for pretty much everything on tablet and desktop. `large' is reserved for CTAs or marketing purposes.

While buttons have an explicit height, they can vary in width. The ideal width of a button is 10px of padding to the left and right of the button's copy.

Buttons have a 2px drop shadow. The shadow color is the dark secondary of the button's main color.

Unless it is one of the buttons mentioned above, all controls are "action blue".

Some buttons use icons instead of or with text for simplicity/clarity. The same spacing rules mentioned above apply: 10px of padding.


##Input Fields
There are three states for input fields: `normal`, `active`, and `error`.
